   #States and transitions will be assigned to object based on these table columns.
   #When values from objects columns is same for several states/transitions then these states/transitions will be related to this object
   #You may mention here a several columns. So each unique compination of values of mentioned columns will be considered as one unique object
   objects:
      - Obj1


   #Sequence of transitions and states will be considered based on this field
   sequences:
      - Seq1


   #Transitions will be took from these fields
   #You may mention here a several columns. Each unique combination of values of mentioned columns will be considered as one transition
   transitions:
      - Trans1
      - Trans2

   #States will be took from these fields
   #You may mention here a several columns. Each unique combination of values from mentioned columns will be considered as one state
